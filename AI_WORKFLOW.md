# AI-Assisted Development Workflow
This project was built using an AI-first approach.

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT - architecture, Kotlin code generation, Supabase schema design
- Stitch - AT-powered UI generation
- Android Studio + AI assistance

## Workflow
1. Designed UI using natural language prompts in Stitch
2. Generated database schema using AI
3. Used AI to scaffold MVVM architecture
4. Iteratively refined features using AI debugging and refactoring
5. Used AI to optimize performance and code quality

AI tools were used as a co-developer, not as a replacement for engineering judgment.
