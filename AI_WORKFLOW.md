# AI-Assisted Development Workflow
This project was built using an AI-first approach.

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT - architecture, Kotlin code generation, Supabase schema design
- Stitch - AT-powered UI generation
- Android Studio + AI assistance

## Workflow
1. Designed UI using natural language prompts in Stitch
2. Generated database schema using AI
3. Used AI to scaffold MVVM architecture
4. Iteratively refined features using AI debugging and refactoring
5. Used AI to optimize performance and code quality

## Supabase Setup

- Used AI to draft initial PostgreSQL schema
- Refined schema manually for Supabase Auth compatibility
- Used AI to generate realistic seed quote data
- Implemented relational tables for favorites and collections

## Android App Setup

- Used AI to validate MVVM architecture and package structure
- Manually created project structure and navigation
- Integrated Supabase client with centralized configuration
- Focused on maintainability and clarity before adding features


AI tools were used as a co-developer, not as a replacement for engineering judgment.
